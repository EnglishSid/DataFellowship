## Data visualization - Objective 1 

### Selected dashboard :  [Analytics Dashboard](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/HR-Analytics-Dashboard/td-p/777914)

**Purpose of the dashboard :** 
Executive level dashboard to present current and historical data on the financial, demographic and movement of employees within an organisation.


### Insights

- **Headcount statistics** - does not show any real growth within the company during 2018-2019.  (-2 y/y)
- **Salaries by employee** - presents a potential disbalance in the number of managers to associates 
- **Demographic** - High absentee rate within Technical Consultancy; would want to investigate the reason behind


### Changes
- **Consistency**
The first dashboard presents the headcount statistics for the organisation, with options to select a given year, division or department; this is not carried forward on the other dashboards.

- Option to **expand an individual viewpoint**
Each dashboard page presents a lot of information (approx. 6 charts per page), I would allow users to expand and view a single chart in full screen, ensuring labels and all supporting information can be clearly shown.   On a number of the charts axis labels are missing and it assumes the viewer

- Drop the final dashboard - **Employee Details**
The final dashboard presents a single viewpoint for an employee, this doesn't follow the flow of the other 3 dashboards and should be excluded here and presented separately (within an employees HR profile).
