# Develop maths skills for data

https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer/playlists has a whole load of videos, mostly on machine learning, and also some stats fundamentals.

https://www.analyzemath.com/statistics.html has a number of sections on different topics, with explanations, examples, and practice exercises.

https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/d.j.wilkinson/teaching/mas131/bignotes.pdf are some lecture notes giving an overview of a lot of key topics (though they do seem a bit short on examples)

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/ is an open MIT course, but might be a bit too advanced
